##.Why It Is Used:
	Organization: Keeps all contact details in one place for easy access.
	Efficiency: Helps quickly search and retrieve a contact.
	Convenience: Eliminates the need for physical notebooks or papers.
	Automation: Can integrate with phones to directly make calls, send messages, or emails.





1. Start with an Overview
Briefly describe the purpose of the application.

Example:
"My Phone Book Application is designed to store, manage, and retrieve contact information efficiently.
 It's a simple tool to keep all contacts organized and easily accessible."

2. Core Features
	1.Add Contact: Users can add a new contact with details like name, phone number, and email.
	2.Search Contact: Allows searching for a contact by name or number.
	3.Update Contact: Edit an existing contact's details.
	4.Delete Contact: Remove a contact from the list.
	5.List All Contacts: View all saved contacts in an organized format.
	6.Save and Retrieve Data: The application ensures data persistence using a file/database.


Example:
"For example, if a user wants to add a contact for 'John Doe' with the phone number '9876543210', they can use the 'Add Contact' feature. Similarly, if they search for 'John Doe', the app will instantly display the contact details."

3. Technical Details
	Programming Language: JSP and Servlet.

6. Possible Enhancements


Example:
"In the future, I plan to add features like syncing with cloud storage, 

7. Wrap Up


Example:
"Developing this application enhanced my skills in Java programming, file handling, and logical problem-solving. It also taught me the importance of designing user-friendly applications."
